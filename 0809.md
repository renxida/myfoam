Found information on [[why sgx didn't work]]

Summary of day's work:

measurements/:
    - [[way_6uops.ipynb]]: confirm that more than 6 uops per way causes MITE to activate and prevents uop cache from caching anything
    - [[inc_mov_blocks.ipynb]]: attempt to measure dsb size without using no-ops. Success with IDQ.DSB_UOPS; no success with RDTSC if instructions used form dependency chain (no ILP; but if there's 3 chains and 3 parallel ILP it still works); can be used to explain why we were using no-ops.
    - [[inc_mov_way_6uops.ipynb]]: also attempted to not use nop for way_6uops; result much less impressive.
  
  Todo in [[0810]]aa :
    - finalize [[way_6uops.ipynb]] graph
    - make [[inc_mov_blocks.ipynb]]
    - start writing [[dsb characterization study]]
