# 0811

## Meeting notes
- My premeeting Agenda


- meeting notes
    - size and associativity
        - x axis -> # of lines
        - ticks to 64 instead of 100
        - try to motivate exploit a bit: talk about prime & probe; lead to construction process of eviction set
    - 6 ways per block
        - use DSB_mite switch pfc to explain staircase pattern in graph
    - next section: replacement policy (not written yet)
        - characterize replacement policy\
    - graphics for the attacks
        - covert channel: tables for bandwidth
            - Error correction?
                - recent literature on side / covert channel attacks for community standards for ECCs 
                - for non-inflated bandwidth
        - side channel: bitrate of information leak (basically the same thing, except no ECC)
        - graph of signal read from dsb: latencies y, bit x, threshold as line through
        - effectiveness of attack with defences? 
            - pfc-based
                - cache misses with vs not with attacks
                - port contention
                - L3 and L1 
            - other spectre defences
    - goal: make audience feel like they learning and build interest in exploit
    - more details, cut later
    - code / pseudocode
    - TODO: automatic generation of exploit code: generate_zebra.py

classes to take:
operating systems
    - not research-oriented
    - really advanced 
    - programming heavy
    - good because i don't have OS undergrad
mobile & iot security:
    - good chance of publication
if take ML class: take research-oriented
    - course projects, good chance of publication
