Dean & Kazam's comments
- spectre gadgets never found... but this!!!
    - go through code to find this
        - Tools:
            - compiler pass? 
            - ask Greg
- Execution before issue?
    - stack exec engine, in rename stage    
        - auto ++ / -- esp without issuing uOp for that
    - r->r moves: resolved before exec
    - something that results in secret dependent Decode?
