Group meeting
- pfcs:
    - check mpki miss/k instruction; a lot of instructions, a few misses
    - add fake references until i get to spectre levels

Meeting w/ Kazem
- [ ] graphics for loop, in loop
- [ ] spectre gadget finder

Meeting w/ Ashish
- gadget search
    - FastSpec: Scalable Generation and Detection of Spectre Gadgets Using Neural Embeddings https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14147.pdf
        - https://gitlab.com/igoto/spectre-detector/-/tree/master/
        - 
- Continuous monitoring
    - run attack, continuously monitor PFCs, show difference
    - perf script: show records
    - perf record: make records
    - compare: ours, spec, dummy: dummy only does "training" loops
    - graph: 3 bars? lines over time? show that there isn't no signal differentiating ours with dummy, unless we use mite2dsb switch pfc
- histogram: distribution of cached vs uncached timings in characterization section
- gadget search?
    - FastSpec: Scalable Generation and Detection of Spectre Gadgets Using Neural Embeddings
        - use statistics from here
    - [[paper-outline]]
    - see 4~5 prominent prgrams and find frequency of our gadget vs regular spec gadgets
    - pattern matching?
        - untrusted index as function argument?
        - bounds check
        - look at methodology in spector detector and others
- detail on attacks?

!!! TODO !!!:qual proposal, do proposal and exam before paper published.
