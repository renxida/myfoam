add to [[Paper Outline]]
    - diagrams for DSB functionality
        - DSB vs decode pipeline
        - associativity (sets & ways)
        - mapping
        - show contention and vulnerability (decode penalty)
        - make paper for citable "manual" on uop cache
        - cite intel patent and relevant things
    - attack impact:
        - careful about overselling impact; don't too many figures on market shares and stuff
        - "impacts processors since sandy bridge (20xx)" would be enough
        - mention that ARM has decoded op caches too,
