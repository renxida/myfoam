# Paper Outline

Created [[0727]]

Outline of paper, and todo list for graphs


    - diagrams for DSB functionality

    - attack impact:
        - careful about overselling impact; don't too many figures on market shares and stuff
        - "impacts processors since sandy bridge (20xx)" would be enough
        - mention that ARM has decoded op caches too, 

- intro
- related work
    - [ ] Need to populate [[references]]
- background on DSB & characterization study:
    - purpose: make paper for citable "manual" on uop cache
    - not necessarily graphs, but need experimental results
    - basics data on skylake
        - [x] size? [[size-measurement-code-diagram]]
        - [x] associativity [[associativity-measurement-code-diagram]]?
        - [ ] replacement policy?
    - diagrams
        - DSB vs decode pipeline
        - associativity (sets & ways)
        - mapping
        - show contention and vulnerability (decode penalty)
    - cite intel patent and relevant things
    - writeup about functioning of this structure (DSB)
    - results we have
        - weird loopy replacement policy
            - measure different # loops
        this stuff
    - merge into DSB background

- attack models we tried (maybe divide into covert & side channels, or covert & transient attack)
    - single threaded
        - [ ] bandwidth?
    - sgx (doesn't work)
        - flushes
        - sgx is heavyweight
        - [ ] reference to prove sgx flushes dsb?
    - kernel/user
        - [ ] bandwidth?
    - SMT (ask kazem for code and generate figures, help w/ text)
        - 
    - speculative
        - [ ] bandwidth
    - potentially: side-channel attack on actual library

- why potential mitigations can be hard to implement
    - general case [Lyu, Yangdi & Mishra, Prabhat. (2017). A Survey of Side-Channel Attacks on Caches and Countermeasures. Journal of Hardware and Systems Security. 10.1007/s41635-017-0025-y. ]
        - flush dsb on transition lol (slow)
        - randomized cache, 
    - specific case

- responsible disclosure
    - disclusre happened
    - cve id: anonymize it so reviewers don't know who we are

- conclusion
